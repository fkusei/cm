# restart-notifier simply checks if the ffmpeg pid is still present after a few seconds
# and will then notify the channel. It is invoced after a start of restart.
# Messages are sent using alert-failed.sh or alert-running.sh which will go
# through a ratelimiter to prevent spam and use a simple perl mqtt client to
# send the message which will be picked up by a mqtt listener script on mng.ber
# similar to viri.
